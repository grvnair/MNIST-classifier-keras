MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification with Keras


1.	Trained a Neural network on MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset using Keras.
2.	Built a Keras Sequential model with 3 dense layers having ReLU as activation function. 
3.	As the output here would be classification of the Numbers, used softmax activation on the output layer.
4.	Compiled the model using Adam optimizer and initialized loss as Sparse Categorical Crossentropy. 
5.	Trained the model and achieved accuracy of 97% and loss was minimized to 0.09.
6.	Used Matplotlib to visualize the handwritten numbers for predictions.
